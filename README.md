# QR-bite
QRbite is a restaurant ordering system where customers can scan a QR code at their table to view the digital menu. The menu displays dish images, prices, descriptions, and allows users to add items to a cart and place orders. The system is built using Django and provides a smooth, contactless dining experience.
